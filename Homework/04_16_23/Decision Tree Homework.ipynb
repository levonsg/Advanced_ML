    "1. create a decision_tree.py file;\n",
    "2. this python file should receive as an argument data full path (--data_path) target column name (--target) and 4 possible argument values (max_depth, criterion, max_leaf_nodes and random_state). First two should be neccessary arguments, the other 4, if not given, should get some default values set by you;\n",
    "3. https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html - a tutorial how to add arguments to a python file run;\n",
    "4. the file should read arguments, read dataset, separate X and y according to target column name, handle categorical columns (you can drop them, this task is not about it) and build a decision tree model by given (if not given, default) params of max_depth, class_weight and max_leaf_nodes;\n",
    "5. You don't need to do CV here or tune parameters. You need to just fit the model on whole data;\n",
    "6. The code should save built tree in the same directory as the decision_tree.py file is by name tree.png;\n",
    "7. Besides that, you need to build this tree for classification.csv dataset with your default parameters, save that image as example.png and sent it alongside your code;\n",
